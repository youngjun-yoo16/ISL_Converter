# ISL_Converter
This andorid application converts typed English word to Indian sign-language. There are five primary functions in this application: List, Search, Quiz, Rank, and Contact. The list section lists the inserted words in the application, and when the user touches the word, it automatically displays the corresponding sign-language. Similarly, in the search section, the user can type an English word which he/she wants to translate into Indian sign-language. Quiz section was made for revision purpose in which only those words which were searched by the user would be displayed (+- 10 points for each correct/wrong answer). The rank section effectively demonstrates the rank between users who use the app using the SQL queries and database. The contact section was created to receive any feedback from users so that I could further refine this application.

This ISL Converter is currently being used by visitors of MBCN school who wish to communicate with hearing-impaired students.
